To install, clone this repository into ~/quicklisp/local-projects and run ```(ql:quickload 'qeng-ho)``` in your lisp of choice. Note that this requires [Quicklisp](http://quicklisp.org/).
To start, run ```./qeng-ho.sh COMMAND``` after configuring daemon.conf and possibly adjusting qeng-ho.sh. A list of commands is available [here](http://restas.lisper.ru/en/manual/daemon.html).
